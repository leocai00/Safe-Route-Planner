                                <p> Safe Router Planner can help people plan safe walking routes. The app would evaluate the safety
                                of all possible routes and recommend the <em>safest</em> one for the selected range of time.

                                walking routes planning apps like only evaluate time and distance. The app fills in the blank
                                area and prevents people from crime.</p>
